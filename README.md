Turing Machine Simulator
========================

What and why?
-------------

A small program for simulating a turing machine. 

I've always wanted to develop this when I was a TA for intro to CS given how
annoying it was to grade the turing machine problems. So what better time to
automate the process than when I'm no longer a intro to CS TA?

Usage
-----

### Input

The turing machine instructions should be in a text file with the following
format:

    TO BE DECIDED

### Test cases

Put your test cases in another text file, newline delimited.

### Run

    python tm-simulator.py {instructions} {test-cases}

### Output
